# System-Identifiers
This repository documents identifiers for terminology and identifier systems within the UK health domain. These are used by implementors of the HL7® FHIR® interoperability standard.

## National identifiers
These system identifiers have been agreed with the UK Terminology Centre. These identifiers will be used within national specifications and are recommended for use within local implementations.
